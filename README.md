# Sentiment Analysis for Products on Amazon

This project focuses on analyzing user reviews from Amazon to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards products. 

It leverages a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from Hugging Face, which is known for its ability to understand the context of words in a sentence by looking at both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left).

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Python

Transformers (Hugging Face)

PyTorch

BeautifulSoup


## ðŸŒŸ Features

BERT Model: Utilization of a pre-trained BERT neural network model from Hugging Face for accurate sentiment analysis. BERT is a state-of-the-art model that excels at natural language understanding tasks by capturing the nuances of language in a bidirectional manner, making it ideal for sentiment analysis.

Web Scraping: Extraction of user reviews from Amazon using BeautifulSoup.

Sentiment Classification: Categorization of reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments using the BERT model to understand the context and tone of the text.


## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The project aims to provide insights into customer opinions on Amazon products by analyzing the sentiment expressed in their reviews, allowing businesses to better understand customer satisfaction and product performance.
